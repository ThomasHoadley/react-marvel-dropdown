# Take Home Task

_Senior Frontend Engineer_

Congratulations on making it through to the Take Home Task üéâ¬†Below, you‚Äôll find everything you need to get started with this task.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Don‚Äôt spend more than 8 hours on this task. If it is taking longer, make brief notes outlining what you would do with more time and submit those with everything you produced.

Create an auto-suggest input field, where the user can type the first 2 letters of a Marvel character‚Äôs name and display the available characters in a list below it.

1. Implement your solution using Angular or React
2. Your target browser is the latest Chrome. No need to cater for outdated
   browsers or cross browser compatibility
3. Use the [Marvel API](http://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) to retrieve Marvel characters in real time. You need to
   register for an API key. You will need to add `*` (wildcard) to your authorised referrers in your account. Find the documentation [here](https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/).
4. You may use any functional libraries of your choice
5. You must **not** use a UI component library (e.g [Material](https://material.angular.io/)) or a CSS framework (e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/)) as it defeats the purpose of this exercise
6. When a character is selected (by clicking their name for example), add them to a list somewhere on the page. The user can also remove characters from this list.
7. Write tests for your code. We don‚Äôt expect full coverage here, but choose tests that show off your capabilities.
8. Write brief notes (no more than a paragraph or a few bullet points) outlining what you would like to do next if you were to develop this app further.

### Criteria (what‚Äôs important)

- Excellent user experience
- Clean, modern design
- Bug-free code
- Angular/React implementation using best-practices
- Well implemented tests
- A thoughtful commentary discussing further development

---

### Output (what we‚Äôre looking for)

- One link to a public GitHub or GitLab repository containing
  - The complete code of your solution
  - Clean Git history showing iterative progress
  - Instructions for building, running, and testing the code in the ReadMe file. We will not be debugging any problems, so make sure it will run for us.
  - Short markdown commentary on any interesting highlights, challenges, gotchas, decisions made along the way
- Any other files requested above, attached to the email
- Brief notes on how you would approach any remaining or incomplete tasks (maximum 2 sentences per task)
- Send to Dylan ([dylan@thisthat.tt](mailto:dylan@thisthat.tt))
